- Is a Julia Implementation of Sparse Identification of Non-Linear Dynamical Systems - See https://www.pnas.org/content/113/15/3932 
- To give you a sense of what we do, look at the figures below. They correspond to the Numerical Solution of the Lorenz System obtained from the Tsit5 integrator and the corresponding trajectory obtained from SINDY
